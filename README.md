# Boardwalk Games - Half-Guided Project

## Overview

This repository contains the starter code for a half-guided project as part of the coding bootcamp curriculum. The project is themed around classic boardwalk games and serves as a learning exercise to help you gain experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before creating your own website from scratch.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Practice structuring web pages using **HTML**.
- Enhance your **CSS** skills for styling and layout.
- Implement interactive features and game logic using **JavaScript**.
- Learn how to organize files and manage a simple web project.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/curtisnlogan/boardwalk-games.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Project Structure**  
   Open the project in your preferred code editor. The repository includes:  
   - `index.html`: The main homepage of the website.  
   - `css/`: A directory containing the stylesheet(s) (e.g., `styles.css`).  
   - `js/`: A directory for JavaScript files (e.g., `script.js`).  
   - `games/`: A directory where individual game HTML files will be added.  
   - `assets/`: A directory for images, sounds, or other media (if needed).

3. **Run the Project**  
   Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the current state of the website.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`index.html`**: The main entry point of the website, including navigation to individual game pages.  
- **`css/`**: Contains the stylesheet(s) for the website. You may need to modify or add styles as you build the games.  
- **`js/`**: Contains JavaScript files for implementing game logic and interactivity.  
- **`games/`**: This is where you will create individual HTML files for each game.  
- **`assets/`**: A directory to store any images, sounds, or other media files used in the games.

## Project Tasks

Your goal is to build upon the provided starter code to create a fully functional website featuring at least **three boardwalk-style games**. Below are the key tasks you need to complete:

- **HTML**  
  - Create individual HTML pages for each game inside the `games/` directory.  
  - Ensure each game page includes all necessary elements, such as game boards, score displays, and controls.

- **CSS**  
  - Style the entire website to create a cohesive and visually appealing design.  
  - Make sure the website is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

- **JavaScript**  
  - Implement the game logic for each game, either in `script.js` or in separate JavaScript files.  
  - Ensure that each game is interactive and fully functional.

- **Navigation**  
  - Add navigation links on the homepage (`index.html`) to allow users to access each game page.

- **Documentation**  
  - Update this README to include:  
    - A brief description of each game and how to play it.  
    - Any additional features or enhancements you've implemented.  
    - Known issues or areas for improvement (optional).

## Submission

Once you have completed the project, follow the instructions provided by your bootcamp for submission. This may involve:

- Pushing your code to a personal GitHub repository.  
- Submitting a pull request to the original repository.  
- Uploading your project files to the bootcamp's learning platform.  

Ensure you include any required documentation or reflections as specified by your instructors.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while working on the project, try the following:

- **Check the Console:** Open the developer tools in your browser and look for error messages in the console.  
- **Validate Your Code:** Use online validators to check your HTML and CSS for syntax errors.  
- **Ask for Help:** Reach out to your instructors or peers if you're stuck.

## Project Requirements

- **Games:** Implement at least **three different games**, each demonstrating unique aspects of web development.  
- **Interactivity:** Each game must include interactive elements that respond to user inputs.  
- **Styling:** The website should have a consistent theme and be visually appealing.  
- **Code Quality:** Write clean, well-organized code. Use comments to explain your logic where necessary.

## Contributing

Feel free to experiment with additional games or features, but ensure you meet the minimum project requirements first.

## Going Further

Once you've completed the required tasks, consider enhancing your project with:

- **Sound Effects:** Add audio elements to make the games more engaging.  
- **High Scores:** Use local storage to save and display high scores for each game.  
- **Leaderboard:** Create a leaderboard to display top scores across all games.
